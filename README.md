# QQLMPA
This is the code of QQLMPA, which is proposed in &lt;A quasi-opposition learning and Q-learning based marine predators algorithm for global continuous optimization problems>

In this paper, a quasi-opposition based learning and Q-learning based marine predators algorithm (QQLMPA) is proposed. This offers multiple improvements over standard MPA. Firstly, Q-learning allows MPA to fully use the information generated by previous iterations. Secondly, quasi-opposition based learning serves to increase population diversity, reducing the risk of convergence to inferior local optima.

Get_Functions_details.m includes test function 'F5' and the Speed reducer design 'P11'. You can choose the function name in the main.m.
